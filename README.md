## Installing and running on your local machine

I use yarn because it's better, however you can choose to be primitive and use NPM:

### `yarn install`

This command installs.

### `yarn start`

This command starts the project.

### `yarn build`

This command builds the project.

### `yarn eject`

I have no idea what this does.
