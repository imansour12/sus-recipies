# Getting Started with Sus Recipies

This project was created with Ract, here's a link to it. [here's a link to it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley).

I use Axios to make requests to the API. If you want to use fetch() you can change it.

## Installing and running on your local machine

Before installing make sure you create a .env file in the root of the project and put in your API key like this:
REACT_APP_API_KEY=fo0baR1b2

Replace fo0baR1b2 with your API key.

I use yarn because it's better, however you can choose to be primitive and use NPM:

### `yarn install`

This command installs.

### `yarn start`

This command starts the project.

### `yarn build`

This command builds the project.

### `yarn eject`

I have no idea what this does.
